                        “I didn’t have a go-to brownie recipe before writing this book, and since they're such an oft-requested, universally loved treat, I set out to develop one. This felt like a simple task since brownies, almost by definition, are easy to make, but I botched a lot of batches. It was the chewiness that eluded me, and because I was determined to keep these hand-makeable and weeknight-friendly, I didn’t want to pull out any crazy stops. After much tweaking–and realizing that chilling them is an essential step–this is the winning formula.I call them my “forever” brownies, since I don’t think I’ll make any other brownie recipe again." –Claire Saffitz via Dessert Person

                    <h3>
                        Preheat the oven and prepare the pan:
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        arrange an oven rack in the center position and preheat the oven to 350ºF. Lightly butter the pan and set aside.
                    </p>

                    <h3>
                        Bloom the cocoa:
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                        in a large heatproof bowl, whisk the cocoa powder and ¼ cup boiling water until smooth.
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        Melt the chocolate, butter, and oil:
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                        add the semisweet chocolate, butter, and oil to the bowl with the cocoa mixture and set it over a medium saucepan filled with about 1 inch of simmering (not boiling) water. Warm the mixture gently, stirring occasionally, until the chocolate and butter are melted and the mixture is smooth. Remove the bowl from the heat and let cool until lukewarm.
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        Add sugars and egg:
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                        whisk the granulated and brown sugars into the chocolate mixture. It Will look grainy and you might see some of the fat star to separate from the rest of the mixture, which is normal. Add the whole egg, egg yolks, and vanilla and whisk vigorously until the mixture comes together and looks very thick, smooth, and glossy.  
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        Add dry ingredients:
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                        add the flour, malted milk powder, and salt and whisk slowly until everything is combined, then whisk more vigorously until the batter is very thick, a full 45 seconds.
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        Fold in the chocolate and bake:
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                        add the milk chocolate to the batter and fold with a flexible spatula to distribute. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan, spreading in an even layer all the way to the corners. Bake  the brownies until the surface is shiny and puffed and the center is dry to the touch but still soft when pressed, 25 to 30 minutes.
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        Cool, chill, and cut:
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                        allow the brownies to cool in the pan until they are no longer hot, about 1 hour, then refrigerate until the bottom of the pan feels cold, about 1 hour longer. Slice the brownies into 16 squares.
                    </p>
