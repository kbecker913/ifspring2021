<p>I don't want your concern</p>
<p>As some consolation prize</p>
<p>And I don't want to be your friend</p>
<p>Just one of the guys</p>
<p>I am nobody's</p>
    <br>
<p>We left home when we were teens</p>
<p>I grew bored of simple things</p>
<p>You gave me another chance</p>
<p>A renegade, holding your hand</p>
<p>I was somebody's</p>
    <br>
<p>I wasn't ordinary, ordinary, ordinary</p>
<p>I was inordinary, ordinary</p>
<p>I wasn't ordinary, ordinary, ordinary</p>
<p>I was inordinary, ordinary</p>
    <br>
<p>Life began in seventh grade</p>
<p>When me and mama got away</p>
<p>Came home from school one afternoon</p>
<p>She was waiting in the car for me</p>
<p>She said, "Don't worry"</p>
    <br>
<p>Started over, Tennessee</p>
<p>Rent was cheap and we were free</p>
<p>I wish that feeling stuck around</p>
<p>There's a beauty to be found, hmm</p>
    <br>
<p>In the ordinary, ordinary, ordinary</p>
<p>In the ordinary, ordinary</p>
<p>In the ordinary, ordinary, ordinary</p>
<p>In the ordinary, ordinary</p>
